      <h3>About TeaTeaRPG</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Alex McGuigan, an Astoria NYC based side-hustler. I organize mini-RPG festivals in Queens and help run an
        arts mutual aid group, Queens Collaborative. I've been playing RPGs for more than 20 years, starting when I was
        10 years old.

      <p>
        Before I started TeaTeaRPG, most of my RPG experience had been in traditional adventure systems like D&D, World
        of Darkness, GURPS, and d20 Modern.
        However, I'd long been curious about different types of RPGs; from low crunch adventures like FATE, narrativist
        games like Apocalypse World, or worldbuilding games like Microscope.
        I'd accumulated quite a library of different indie RPGs, I just needed to find people to play them with.
        I decided that I'd host tea parties, open to the public, with a new tea and a new RPG in the pot every time and
        it grew from there!
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily focus on self-published RPGs that can be completed in one session. They typically have small
        rulesets, do not require a traditional Game Master role, and/or are designed to be played fresh with every game.
        Often they are not adventure games; I look for games that have interpersonal, worldbuilding, romantic, horror,
        or philosophical game themes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every game, I put one of my favorite teas in the pot. Usually these are <i>camellia sinensis</i> teas from
        China, Vietnam, Korea, or Japan. We'll have a short discussion about the tea and then take it through its whole
        steep cycle during the game!
