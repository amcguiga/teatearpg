      <h2>Case Summary</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          On January 13th, 199?, a paranormal incident was reported at Paranormal Inc.’s office. The full investigative
          team was immediately dispatched. The team found multiple ghosts escaping from a compromised ghost containment
          unit on premise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within several hours, the containment systems were brought back online and the ghosts were (mostly) recovered.
          The cause of the containment breach was an ex-employee who contracted a demon to disrupt the municipal power
          connection to the containment units.

          <h4>"Zoot", Ghost <span>(1)</span></h4>
          <p>
            A dancing and brass-playing ghost from the 40s. Originally found several years ago at a Squirrel Nut Zippers
            concert. The ghost opened for the band, but would not leave the stage. Peter had been dragged to the concert
            by
            his wife, so he captured the ghost. Escaped from containment unit Z during the incident and stole wontons
            from
            the bullpen snack table.

            Before the Zoot Ghost escaped from the bullpen, Doris possessed the ghost, pulling out a (real) checkered
            bracelet often worn by second and third wave ska fans.

            Anderson dug into a box of records stashed under Zora’s desk to pull out two items from the same time as the
            Zoot Ghost’s original capture. He found a torn motivational poster (“Reach for the…”) and a faded old bonus
            check (uncashed).

          <p>
            A guest at the party, present in the bullpen. Initially a weak suspect due to her long-standing
            fascination
            with
            paranormal haunting and her knowledge of check fraud vis-a-vis the old bonus check. Cleared of suspicion.

            spectral drinks through the back room; later re-appeared sobbing in a corner.

            Remi sensed Henry’s sadness and tied to it an object in the room with similar feelings. The group found a
            page
            of a performance evaluation of a former employee. The employee would take long lunch breaks, record over
            audio
            tapes, and play really loud ska music. They also found a photo of former employees, including someone with
            a
            checkered bracelet.

            In discussion with the investigators in the back room, Elaine identified the employee from the photo. She
            didn’t
            remember his real name (“we always used his nickname”), but she did remember that they hooked up an 8
            track
            system from their own car to play music in the bullpen.

        <span>Proposed by Dr. Doc, PhD. </span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Archie was furious about being fired. He scraped together money to sign a contract with the demon Naberius, who
        retrieves lost titles and honors. The demon cursed the municipal power supply connection to the containment
        units.
        As this happened on Friday night, the ghosts would have had all weekend to escape and cause havoc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, the entire team was present in the office due to Doris’s retirement party. Dr. Doc was able to use
        Doris’s etco-spectro-electro-magnetivity to jury rig a new power connection to the grid. This involved severe
        electrocution for Doris. Efforts to fix the connection properly are ongoing.

        <ul>
          <li>Date: 2/9/199?</li>
          <li>Recorded by: Bobby Braun, archivist (probationary)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        The team seems to have acquired cash <i>(ed: according to Remi, “Naberius doesn’t accept USD”, whatever that
          means)</i> to pay the outstanding invoice to prevent the power from being disabled in the imminent future.
        Revenue estimate ongoing because it’s unclear how many bills are still outstanding.
        <i>(ed: do we have an accountant? Or a bookkeeper?)</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Doris has been extracted from the power grid. During this shocking experience <i>(ed: her words)</i> she
        realized
        that she can write a new bucket list post-mortem. She is taking her disability time to get a head start on
        completing her new goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The demonic incursion has led to controversy within the office. Remi is really worried about this new category
        of
        paranormal things, he thinks that his “exercise to exorcise” blueprint might not work on them? Dr. Doc is
        thrilled
        about this and she’s buying every demonicon she can find.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anderson apparently lost a lot of money on the case and he’s pretty bummed about it.
        <i>(ed: He and Zora keep talking about doing check fraud. Did they learn that from Mme. Nightwing? Should I say
          anything to anyone?)</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        The ghost dog Zeppelin was not returned to containment unit, as Zora has apparently adopted the dog. She reports
        that Zeppelin is a very good boy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peter has been missing his long lunches with Doris. Now he keeps showing up to Zora’s desk and asking her to go
        to
        lunch with him instead. Every day they play fetch in the park for hours with Zeppelin.
