# teatearpg
A monthlyish event hosted by Alex McGuigan in his apartment. We’ll drink tea and play indie RPGs.

The Games
I’m focusing on self-published games that are friendly for one-shots. They’ll typically have small rulesets, GM-less or GM-lite game structures, and/or zine session concepts. Typically, they won’t be adventure games; they will deal with interpersonal, worldbuilding, romantic, or philosophical game elements.

The Tea (and snacks)
There will be one of my favorite teas in the pot each session and we’ll take it through its entire steep cycle. These will usually be Chinese camellia sinensis teas but I’ve also got the tea and strainers to make individual steeps if you’ve got another preference. I’ll serve snacks and will welcome anyone bringing food or tea that they’re interested in.
